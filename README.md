# TypeScript Playground.
A repository to explore TypeScript. Burning questions I'd like to answer:
* Will it work with Grunt?
* Will it work on OS X?
* Will it blend?

# Getting Started
Here's how you can get started playing with TypeScript with this repository.
* Pull down this repo.
* Change directory to repo.
* npm install
* grunt
* The compiled JavaScript will appear in the "compiled-scripts" folder.
